# SlotGame
Did some fun coding for a random slot machine with reference and help from YouTube.
You can deposit money, choose how many lines you want to bet on and spin to see if you win. The game generates a 3x3 grid of random symbols based on probabilities, and you win when the symbols match across the chosen lines.
